🌟 Project Description

🚀 InterviewPrep Platform is a full-stack interview preparation website built using a modern React.js + Node.js architecture. The platform helps users practice and prepare for real technical interviews with structured question modules, coding challenges, timed mock tests, and expert-style interview experience.

Users can explore interview questions on topics like Data Structures, Algorithms, OOP, DBMS, JavaScript, Computer Networks, and Operating Systems, participate in mock interview rounds, and evaluate their readiness through performance stats and test scores.

The platform delivers a clean, interactive, and fast interview preparation environment, making it easier for students and developers to prepare efficiently for technical rounds.
